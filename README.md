# Simori-ON-Simulator
A simple attempt at the simulation of a Tenori ON machine. For an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcpTMO0CrI.

Buttons on the board explained:
L1 - Changes the instrument
L2 - Changes the velocity of notes
L3 - Changes the speed of the loop
L4 - Changes the starting point of the loop

R1 - Changes the current layer
R2 - Save the current configuration to a file
R3 - Load the current configuration from a file
R4 - Network mode - current configuration of the board sent over the network to another board waiting for it (press R4 on
both boards and select master for one and slave for another)

Pressing OK when the board is ON takes it to SHOP MODE which plays some popular tunes.
